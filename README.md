GETTING STARTED WITH Memoranda
==============================

This is your guide!

Welcome to Memoranda
--------------------

Memoranda is a different type of modern day technology.

Memoranda is a personal tool designed to help someone to organize his/her work and actual projects. Memoranda is intended for the people, whose daily work is shared between a few different projects. This is a tool helping to keep your projects, irrespective of their nature. It aims to solve the following needs:

- To have the one solid place where you can see a list of current projects, browse and edit them, add new and remove out-of-date projects.
- To edit and browse the project documentation. As almost all projects are the processes in a time, we assumed that the time-based diaries would be a better form of organizing the project-related documents, rather than folders and files.
create and edit "to-do" checklists. It allows to set the time bounds for every task in checklist, mark a task's progress and see what is already done and on what you should pay your attention today.
- To have an access to project-related resources (such as external files and web-pages) within one solid workplace. You can collect shortcuts to resources from various locations (local files as well as internet resources) and define an application for opening an each resource type.
- To schedule the events and get the notifications when they are occurred.

You can download the latest release build from the github website. Your feedback is very important for us. Feel Free to submit your opinions and suggestion about Memoranda, bug reports and other contributions. Enjoy!
