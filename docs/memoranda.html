            WHAT IS MEMORANDA?
        -->
        
        
            
        <p>
        Memoranda is a personal tool designed to help someone to organize his/her work and actual projects.

        Memoranda is intended for the people, whose daily work is shared between a few different projects. This is a tool helping to keep your projects, irrespective of their nature. It aims to solve the following needs:
            <ul>
                
                <li>To have the one solid place where you can see a list of current projects, browse and edit them, add new and remove out-of-date projects.

                <li>To edit and browse the project documentation. As almost all projects are the processes in a time, we assumed that the time-based diaries would be a better form of organizing the project-related documents, rather than folders and files.
            
                <li> create and edit  "to-do" checklists. It allows to set the time bounds for every task in checklist, mark a task's progress and see what is already done and on what you should pay your attention today.

                <li>To have an access to project-related resources (such as external files and web-pages) within one solid workplace. You can collect shortcuts to resources from various locations (local files as well as internet resources) and define an application for opening an each resource type.

                <li>To schedule the events and get the notifications when they are occured.
            </ul>
        </p>
