<li> Translations of dialogs
<li> Resizing of dialogs conform to the XP-style look&feel

    <p align="center" ><b>Memoranda 1.0a-20030930 release:</b></P>
===================================================================================

The project has been moved from jnotes.sf.net. The current version was renamed
to "Memoranda 1.0 alpha".

===================================================================================

     For the ones that are helping with the translation to other languages ...

    <li> Use an UTF-enabled text editor to edit the files. JEdit 4.1 Final (editor
          written in Java) is a good choice.
    <li> use UTF-8 encoding instead of your default system codepage.
    <li> UTF-8 has support for multi-languages, so also special chars.
    <li> Be sure to choose the UTF-8 encoding to avoid problems with
      special characters that needs to be displayed.

       !!! If you do not follow this tip this can give unexpected results !!!
